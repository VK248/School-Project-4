<h1>School Life</h1>

<h2>Rooftop Turf</h2>
<p>The Rooftop is normally where we have all our sports events. It is a lot of fun to play Football on the turf. We also have a 50 meter pool. The rooftop is my favourite place in the school because it is a lot of fun to play Football over there. </p></div><hr>
<img class="responsive" src="https://www.oberoirealty.com/images/assets/original/2678_Auditorium.jpg">
<h2>Auditorium</h2>
<p>I really like the Auditorium because it is very big and useful. We use the Auditorium for plays,musical's, movie's or an important announcement. When there is an important announce mostly everyone for Grade 1-5 come to the Auditorium. It is also very entertaining to watch what is being shown. </p><hr>

<h2>Lobby</h2>
<p>I like the lobby because thats the first place I see when I enter the building. It is also where you meet up with your friends before you go up for your classes. The lobby is a very nice place also because you can just chat and do nothing till you go up. </p><hr>

    <p class="p_modal">Bindu Oberoi Is The Chapeirson Of Oberoi International School.Oberoi International School (OIS) is a Co-ed (IB) International Baccalaureate school.[1] It was instituted on 17 July 2008 at Oberoi Garden City for Nursery to Grade 12 with internationally recognized education in Mumbai, India. In 2017, the school opened its second campus on Jogeshwari–Vikhroli Link Road (JVLR).[2]

        Both the campuses adopted a "One School, Two Campuses" model, wherein both the campuses employ the same guiding statements, philosophy, curriculum, policies, procedures, fee structure, all operating under the strategic direction of a Board of Trustees of the Oberoi Foundation.</p>

    <p class="p_modal">Stephen Augeri Is The Head Of The Oberoi JVLR Campus.We are an IB Continuum School offering the Primary Years Programme, Middle Years Programme, and Diploma Programme to over 900 students in Nursery through Grade 11 during the 2020-21 academic year.

School websites can communicate a variety of messages depending on the intended audience. Our school puts students at the center of all that we do, so we naturally assume that prospective students (and likely their parents as well) will be browsing our website with a very particular question in mind: What do students experience at Oberoi International School? I believe that an OIS education features:

A holistic experience that develops a child’s intellectual, physical, social, emotional, and creative potentials.
An inquiry-based experience, where students actively question, explore, discover, and problem-solve.
A culture that values student agency, where students have the power to direct and take responsibility for their learning.
A collaborative environment that encourages open-mindedness, empathy, communication, and organization.
The effective use of technology to support and enhance learning.
Exceptional facilities to support teaching and learning.
Qualified, experienced teachers who care not only about students’ academic progress but also their well-being.
An overall experience that is rigorous, rewarding, and FUN!
I hope that you enjoy your time exploring our website. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.-Stephen Augeri

    <p class="p_modal">Peter Murphy Is The Head Of The Oberoi OGC Campus.As you navigate through our website, you will get to know us, our mission and the character of our school and see how we prepare our young people for a fulfilling life of personal success and academic excellence.

At OIS, we recognise that to prepare students for our increasingly complex and interconnected world, we must provide them with new ways of thinking and new ways of collaborating in solving our most pressing global issues.

As such, our mission goes far beyond preparing students for good universities and prosperous careers; we want to create globally-minded and critical-thinking innovators ready to re-shape the world for the better. Through the curriculum of the International Baccalaureate (IB), we develop the whole human being. A confident young person courageous in their willingness to question what they observe around them. A student able to take complex and often disparate knowledge, concepts and skills and forge these into new and unique ways of solving problems and adding value to their world.

We make learning relevant and exciting for students, as we continually draw connections between what they learn in the classroom and the real world. Perhaps most importantly, we encourage our young people to reflect on their learning - and to act on it in the service of others. We believe that learning should inform action and create impact.

We are proud of our inclusive entry policy, which means students of all abilities are welcomed here. Our academic results consistently place us among the top international schools in the world, while our sport, music, drama and other activities are all of the highest quality.

This is a wonderful time to be at OIS. We hope you will come visit us, spend some time at the school and experience first hand the unique, vibrant and wonderfully inclusive community.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about OIS.-Peter Murphy

<h1>Whats New</h1>
<h2>MYP</h2>
<img src="https://oberoi-is.org/img/learning/mypios-bg.jpg">
<p>

The Middle Years Programme is a rigorous and challenging  five year programme  for 11 to 16 year olds.  MYP encourages students  to make practical connections between their studies and the real world, preparing them for success in further study and in life.

The programme empowers students to inquire into a wide range of issues and ideas of significance locally, nationally and globally. The result is young people who are creative, critical and reflective thinkers.

At OIS, students can opt to pursue MYP Certificate, MYP course or a school based MYP certificate. The following table outlines the subjects and pathways offered through the five years of the programme:
OIS JVLR have added 9th and 10th grade recently to MYP. Lots of students have joined and more are to come. They also may be planning to add 11th and 12th grade to MYP.

<h2>ECA</h2>
<img src="https://oberoi-is.org/img/jvrlcampus/DSC_3246.jpg">
<p>The ECA program is designed to provide our students with an opportunity to have enriching experiences beyond the normal school day. The primary goal of ECAs is for students to have fun while learning important life skills and developing mastery of certain skills. The program is not competitively driven, but instead, is focused on exposing students to new experiences and enriching their lives. ECAs will allow students to try new experiences or participate in areas they are already passionate about. Each ECA aims to be student centered and to maximize student participation in the activity.

In semester 1 ECAs are run from first week of September until mid-December, and in semester 2 from the first week of February to mid-May tentatively. ECAs run from 3:00 p.m. - 4:10 p.m. on weekdays.
More and more ECA's are being added and more students are joining them. There are ECA'S of all types like Sports based,Annual ECA,Perfomance Based and Class room based.</p></section></center>
